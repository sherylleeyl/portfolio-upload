            <p> Being a KL girl myself, I am so excited to share with you a few hot spots around my city. Below are places that brought me immense comfort throughout the years. </p>
            <h2> 1. PETRONAS Twin Towers </h2>
                <p> The PETRONAS Twin Towers is a destination you cannot (and will not) miss when visitng Kuala Lumpur. Standing 452 metres tall, it was known to be the tallest building in the world in 1998 when it was first completed and retained its world-title claim to fame until 2004 when Taipei's 101 was built. At its feet lies the iconic Kuala Lumpur Convention Center (KLCC). </p>
                <p> KLCC is a one-stop destination for entertainment, commercial and a business focal point. It is home to some of the most popular landmarks in Malaysia, making it a popular tourist destination. With a plethora of options to choose from - dining, arts, culture, recreation, sightseeing, shopping and entertainment - you will not be stuck for ideas on what to do around here. </p>

            <div class="kch">
                <h2> 2. Kwai Chai Hong </h2>
                <p> Kwai Chai Hong (鬼仔巷) is the city's latest project in preserving the Chinese heritage stretching back to as far as the 1960s. It is a small alley behind Petaling Street filled with numerous of murals that depict the life that it once was decades ago.  </p>
                
                <p>Kwai Chai Hong is also referred to as the "Ghost Lane" (directly translated from Cantonese). Rumor has it that the name came about long ago when the screams and laughters of mischevious Chinese-migrant kids mimicked the ‘kwai chai’ sounds. </p>
                
                <p> Today, Kwai Chai Hong is filled with vibrant colors and different eateries surrounding the humble area. If you are in town, this is somewhere you definitely have to visit!</p>

                    </div>
        
                <p> After you are done taking a trip down memory lane, stop by Ho Kow Kopitiam to quench your thirst and fill your belly with some Hainan coffee and kaya toast. PS. It is my go-to breakfast order!</p>

            </div>

            <div class="batu-caves">
                <h2> 3. Batu Caves </h2>
                    <p> Batu Caves is home to one of the most significant Hindu shrines in the world: a joyful homage to Lord Murugan, who triumphed over the demons in Tamil Hindu lore. The massive staircase that leads to the caves is comprised of bright bands of color. It almost feels like you are ascending a rainbow into the chambers of the gods.</p>
                    
                    <p> The main attraction though is the Temple Cave. What you should know however, is that visitors must ascend 400 feet (123 meters) into the 400-million-year-old limestone caverns in order to get there.</p>

            <div class="icc-pudu"> 
                <h2> 4. ICC Pudu </h2>
                    <p> This time, I'm sharing with you somewhere very close to my heart - ICC Pudu. </p>
                    
                    <p> ICC Pudu is a Heritage Food Center filled with many famous Malaysian Chinese eateries. Located just a few miles away from the city center, this indoor morning market is a local haunt for early-rising KL folks to get their breakfast cravings fixed!</p>
                   
                    <p> My top food suggestions are: Ah Weng Koh Hainan Tea, Bun Chon Egg Tarts and Aunty's Ginger Egg Wine Noodles. </p>
                    
                    <div class=icc-flex>
                        <img src = "images/icc-pudu-1.jpeg" alt = "Food stalls at ICC Pudu" width="200"/>
                        <img src = "images/icc-pudu-2.jpg" alt = "Uncle selling baos" width="200"/>

                        <img id="icc-grp" src = "images/kl-gpr-1.jpeg" alt = "My grandparents and their humble stall" width="200"/>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p> Since the 1940s, my grandparents started a humble Chinese Herbal Medicine stall in this building. As a little girl, I would follow them to work everyday as they would take care of me while my parents were at work. Hence, this place will forever hold a special place in my heart. </p>
                  
                    <p> Side Note: You can catch me having my favorite Hainanese Coffee and Kaya Toast every Sunday morning. ;)</p>
