    <h1 id="main"> Explore Utah</h1>
    <div class="content-utah">
        <img id="utah-header" src = "images/utah-header.jpg" alt = "Picture overlooking Utah's breathtaking rock formations" width="200"/>
        <p> Out of the many national parks I have visited in the past, Utah still has a very special place in my heart. In the summer of 2021, my friends and I decided that we have put Utah off for way too long. </p>

        <p> Utah is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It is home to five stunning national parks, also known as the "Mighty 5". They are: Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Arches National Park, Canyonlands and Capitol Reefs. </p>

        <h2> 1. Zion National Park </h2>
            <h3> The Narrows </h3>
                <p> A slot canyon through some of the most breath-taking rock forms in Southwest America. </p>

                <p> You may ask: "What's so incredible about this river?" For over 18 million years, the Virgin River has been carving a slot within the canyon - a process that continues till this day - now allowing hikers to hike within the ~16 feet wide and 1,000 feet up channel. </p>

                    <h4> How to get there?</h4>
                        <p> The more popular option is to do the bottoom-up hike (no permit required). To get to the trailhead, take a shuttle to the Temple of Sinawava (Stop 9). Walk along the Riverside walk, it takes you straight to the trailhead. </p>
                        <div class = "zion-flex-1"> 
                            <img src = "images/zion-narrows-solo.jpg" alt = "The Narrows" width="200"/>
                            <img src = "images/zion-narrows.jpg" alt = "The Narrows pt 2" width="200"/>
                        </div>
            <h3> Angel's Landing </h3>
                <p> Angel's Landing is one of the most popular destinations in Zion National Park. The stunning views of Zion Canyon's 270-million-year-old rock layers will time travel you back to the Triassic period when this section of the Colorado Plateau was just a flat basin at sea level.</p>

                <p> In response to concerns about crowding and congestion on the trail, on and after April 1, 2022, everyone who hikes Angels Landing needs to have a permit.</p>

                <p> We left for Angel's Landing at about 8am and started hiking around 9am. It took us about 5.5 hours (including an hour lunch break) to complete the entire trail. Talk about endurance! </p>

                    <h4> How to get there?</h4>
                        <p>Take a shuttle to the Grotto Trailhead (Stop 6). </p>

                        <div class = "zion-flex-2"> 
                            <img src = "images/zion-1.jpg" alt = "View from mid-way of Angel's Landing" width="200"/>
                            <img src = "images/zion-2.jpg" alt = "View from the tip of Angel's Landing" width="200"/>
                            <img id="zion-flex-solo" src = "images/zion-solo.jpg" alt = "View from tip of Angel's Landing" width="200"/>
                        </div>

<h2> 2. Bryce Canyon </h2>
    <p> Bryce canyon is known for its crimson-colored hoodoos, which are spire-shaped rock formations. </p>
    <h3> Sunset Point: Navajo Loop + Wall Street</h3>
    <p> Like everyone else, we hiked Bryce Canyon counter-clockwise from Sunset Point via Navajo Loop and Wall Street. </p>
    <p> The view from Sunset Point was stunning! It overlooks the entire of Bryce Canyon. The gradient color effect of these hoodoos make the place more special than other canyons.</p>
    <p> This was a 3 hour hike with switch-backs at the end of the hike. Come early to avoid crowds and be sure to bring tons of water! </p>

        <img id='bryce-p1' src = "images/bryce-1.jpg" alt = "View of Bryce" width="200"/>

<h2> 3. Arches National Park </h2>
    <div class="arches-flex">
        <img id='arches-p1' src = "images/arches-1.jpg" alt = "The big Arch!" width="200"/>
