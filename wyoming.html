		<h2> 1. Grand Teton National Park </h2>
		<p> Albeit the park being smaller than its fellow peers, Grand Teton is a must-visit! The Teton mountain range was incredible, and there was so much to see.</p>

		<p> Since we only had a day there, we decided to take the ferry across Jenny Lake to hike Cascade Canyon Trail. This has got to be my favorite hike of all. The scenery was breath-taking - we constantly found ourselves in awe! </p>

		<p> After a long hike up the canyon trail, we decided to have lunch at Inspiration point, a famous destination for those who did not want to hike up Cascade Canyon Trail. </p>

		<h2> 2. Yellowstone National Park </h2>
			<p> What's a trip to Wyoming if you don't visit Yellowstone? This park was huge! To get from one end to the other, it takes about 4-7 hours. Can you image how insanely huge that is! </p>
				
			<p> Within Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres, you will have unparalleled opportunities to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the worldâ€™s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River. </p>
			<p> We only spent two days in Yellowstone so we decided to hit the most famous spots within the park!</p>
